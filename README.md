## Work

**Graduate Student Researcher** - [VIDI Lab](https://vidi.cs.ucdavis.edu/), University of California, Davis
- Started and finished four separate Immersive Visualization research projects, two of which included full academic papers that ended in publication, and two that remain as lab demonstrations for visiting students and industry representatives.
- Presented research projects on a regular basis to groups of varying ages and experience levels, educating students and earning funding opportunities for the lab.
- Created a low-latency and high-fidelty immersive volume rendering tool using panoramic omni-directional stereo (ODS) technologies, emphasizing interactivity with large data sets.
- Created personal performance analysis tools and Unity Editor extensions to optimize and streamline immersive visualization systems development.
- Spearheaded the creation of new VR research directions for the lab, developing project ideas for multiple junior researchers.

**Undergraduate Student Researcher** - [HIVE Lab](http://worldheritage.ucmerced.edu/lab), University of California, Merced
- Architected and spearheaded implementation on a large-scale software project to enable advanced and intuitive digsite maintenance through the use of augmented reality headsets and laser-scan data.
- Created a partial digital reconstruction of Bodie, California as an immersive experience with Virtual Reality technology. 

**Software Engineer Intern** - Rosetta Marketing, LLC.
- Created an immersive virtual reality training experience for home appliance technicians.
- Spearheaded the creation of a SOP manual for VR projects.
- With a team of developers,  built and shipped a mobile storefront and back-end API as a proof-of-concept for new personalized customer engagement models.

**Software Engineer in Test Intern** - Rosetta Marketing, LLC.
- Created a fully automated unit test suite for a large-scale mobile API from the ground up, using JUnit with Jenkins build integration.
